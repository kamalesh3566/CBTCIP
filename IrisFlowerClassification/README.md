# Iris Flower Classification with Machine Learning

## Introduction

The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on predicting the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. This classification task leverages machine learning techniques to distinguish between different species of Iris flowers accurately. The goal is to build a model that can classify Iris flowers into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica, based on their attributes.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:

- **Loaded and Preprocessed the Data**: Utilized the Iris dataset, which contains labeled samples of Iris flowers with measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Explored the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between features. Visualized the data to identify patterns and distributions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepared the data for machine learning by handling missing values (if any), scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Model Training**: Trained a Random Forest Classifier on the processed data to predict the species of Iris flowers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualized the results with confusion matrices and feature importance plots.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Steps to Run

1. **Clone the Repository or Download the Project Files**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamalesh3566/IrisFlowerClassification.git

2. **Ensure All Required Libraries Are Installed**:
   Install the necessary libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. **Open the Project in Your IDE or Jupyter Notebook**:
   Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook file (e.g., `Iris.ipynb`).

4. **Load the Provided Dataset**:
   Ensure the dataset file (`Iris Flower.xlsx`) is located in the project directory. Load the dataset in the notebook using appropriate pandas commands. Example:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the dataset
   dataset = pd.read_excel('Iris Flower.xlsx')
   print(dataset.head())
   
5. **Run the Main Script**:
   Execute all code cells in the notebook to train the model and visualize the results. In Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, you can do this by selecting `Run All` from the `Cell` menu or by running each cell individually in sequence.

6. **Make Predictions (Optional)**:
   Use the `predict_species()` function to classify new Iris flower samples based on their measurements. Example:
   ```python
   sepal_length = 5.1
   sepal_width = 3.5
   petal_length = 1.4
   petal_width = 0.2
   predicted_species = predict_species(sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width)
   print(f'Predicted Species: {predicted_species}')

## Key Learnings and Skills Acquired

- **Data Preprocessing**: Gained experience in handling real-world datasets, including loading data from Excel files, scaling features, and preparing data for machine learning models.
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Developed skills in exploring and visualizing data to understand patterns and relationships.
- **Machine Learning**: Acquired knowledge in training and evaluating machine learning models, specifically Random Forest Classifiers.
- **Model Evaluation**: Learned to assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
- **Python Programming**: Enhanced Python programming skills, particularly in using libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

## Conclusion

The Iris Flower Classification project demonstrates the application of machine learning to classify Iris flower species with high accuracy. By using the Random Forest algorithm, the model achieves reliable performance in predicting the species based on sepal and petal measurements. This project provides a solid foundation in machine learning and data preprocessing and highlights the importance of accurate classification in real-world applications.
