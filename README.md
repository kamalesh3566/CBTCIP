# CBTCIP Repository

Welcome to the CBTCIP repository! This repository contains two machine learning projects: **Iris Flower Classification** and **Spam Email Detection**. Each project is housed in its own directory, with its own README and project files. Below you'll find an overview and instructions for each project.

## Projects

**Key Files**:
- `Iris.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the project code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the Iris Flower Classification project.
- `Iris Flower.xlsx`: Dataset containing Iris flower measurements.
- `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`: Configuration files for Git.

**Running the Project**:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3. Open the Project in Your IDE or Jupyter Notebook
4. Load the dataset and run the code cells in `Iris.ipynb`.
5. Make predictions using the `predict_species()` function.

### 2. Spam Email Detection

**Description**: The Spam Email Detection project focuses on building a model to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using machine learning techniques. This project aims to filter out unwanted emails, enhancing productivity and reducing exposure to potential scams and phishing attempts.

**Directory**: [SpamEmailDetection](SpamEmailDetection/)

**Key Files**:
- `Spam.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the project code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the Spam Email Detection project.
- `Spam Email Detection.xlsx`: Dataset containing labeled email data.
- `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore`: Configuration files for Git.

**Running the Project**:
1. Clone the Repository or Download the Project Files
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
3. Open the Project in Your IDE or Jupyter Notebook
4. Load the Provided Dataset:
   Ensure the dataset file (`Spam Email Detection.xlsx`) is located in the `SpamEmailDetection` directory. In the Jupyter Notebook (`Spam.ipynb`), load the dataset using pandas:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   
   # Load the dataset
   df = pd.read_excel('Spam Email Detection.xlsx')
6. **Run the Main Script**:
   Execute all the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook (`Spam.ipynb`) to train the machine learning model and visualize the results. Follow these steps:

   - Open the `Spam.ipynb` notebook file in your Jupyter Notebook or IDE.
   - Sequentially run each code cell by selecting the cell and pressing `Shift + Enter` or by using the "Run" button in the toolbar.
   - The notebook will guide you through the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
   - Ensure you complete all cells to properly train the model and generate results.
7. **Make Predictions (Optional)**:
   After running the notebook, you can use the trained model to classify new email text as spam or ham. To make predictions, follow these steps:

   - Locate or define the `predict_spam()` function in your notebook, which should be implemented to classify text based on the trained model.
   - Use the function to classify custom email text. For example:
   ```python
   email_text = "Congratulations! You've won a $1,000 gift card. Click here to claim your prize."
   
   # Call the function to classify the email
   prediction = predict_spam(email_text)
   
   print(f'Email Classification: {prediction}')

## Key Learnings and Skills Acquired

- **Data Preprocessing**: Gained experience in cleaning and preparing text data for machine learning. This includes handling missing values, normalizing text, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Text Vectorization**: Developed skills in converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF, which captures the importance of words in the text data.
- **Model Training**: Acquired knowledge in training and fine-tuning machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression, for text classification tasks.
- **Model Evaluation**: Learned to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and to interpret these metrics to assess the quality of the model.
- **Visualization**: Improved skills in visualizing model performance and key features using tools like confusion matrices and feature importance plots.

## Conclusion

The Spam Email Detection project illustrates the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world text classification problems. By employing techniques such as text vectorization and Logistic Regression, the model effectively classifies emails as spam or ham with high accuracy. This project not only demonstrates the ability to handle and process text data but also highlights the importance of effective spam detection in cybersecurity.

By sharing this project, I aim to showcase my skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, while also contributing a valuable resource to the community. The techniques and insights gained from this project are applicable to various text-based classification tasks and are crucial for anyone interested in pursuing a career in data science or machine learning.
